# raw-bindings-newton

This is simply a package containing the raw bindings for NEWTON.

It is not meant for direct consumption, instead it is to allow multiple library writers to develop different NEWTON abstractions without having to recreate the part they all have in common.

## WARNING

This currently makes use of some unreleased changes to cffi. I'll remove this note once those issues have been resolved
